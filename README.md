This project focuses on restoring diacritics (vowel marks) to Arabic text using deep learning techniques. Arabic text is often written without diacritics, making it harder to understand, especially for beginners or learners of the language. The goal of this project is to build a robust model that can predict the correct diacritics for given Arabic text.
Project Overview

In this project, I explored various deep learning and transfer learning models to restore the diacritics on Arabic text. I used existing diacritized datasets to train the models and evaluated them for their accuracy and generalization ability.
Key Features:

    Deep Learning Models: Different models, including LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and BERT-based transfer learning, were explored to capture the contextual information in Arabic text for accurate diacritization.

    Data Preprocessing: I developed a preprocessing pipeline that involved tokenizing Arabic text and aligning it with diacritized counterparts.

    Model Performance: The final model achieved competitive results, demonstrating the power of deep learning in solving the Arabic text diacritization problem.

Technologies Used:

    Python
    TensorFlow / Keras
    Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers for BERT models
    Pandas and NumPy
    NLTK for text preprocessing

Project Goals:

    Implement deep learning models for automatic Arabic text diacritization.
    Explore transfer learning using pre-trained models like BERT.
    Create a robust pipeline for text preprocessing and model evaluation.
